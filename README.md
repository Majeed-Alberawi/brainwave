# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Purpose

This project was developed as a learning exercise to explore and understand the fundamentals of React and modern web development practices. It aims to provide hands-on experience with setting up and working with a React application.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
